# Clover
Clover is osu!Debian's a frontend Project and this Project is under heavy development.


## Setup
I will not help setting up the node.js and npm, but just server.

First, install the dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```
And the last thing you have to do, is running the server.
```
$ npm run serve
```
If you want to build a Clover, just follow it.
```
$ npm run build
```
If there's any issues during setup, feel free to post an issue.
